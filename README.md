# Term-Deposit-Prediction
This study examines the use of direct marketing in the finance domain and focuses on a typical bank direct marketing campaign dataset. This type of marketing helps  financial institutions such as banks to target customers who could be interested in their products, offers, and packages. This study's primary goal is to forecast how bank direct marketing will be received by consumers utilising a variety of algorithms, such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and a few more to develop a prediction model using the algorithm that achieved the highest accuracy (XGBoost). The second objective is to provide helpful analysis and visualization to the marketing team for strategizing and decision making situations.
